= Platform Comparison Checklist

A catalog of attributes, qualities, and features supported by listed platforms.

NOTE: This is a work in progress, and is likely incorrect.

See link:cluster-computing.adoc[Notes on Cluster Computing] for definitions.

== Usage

Please feel free to open issues or a pull request to contribute corrections or
add new platforms.

Platforms should be in alphabetical order of project name.

Some attributes are independent or mutually exclusive, the first line in the
table makes this clear.

* *O* denotes mutually exclusive properties
* *X* denotes supported property, one or more
* *NA* denotes not applicable
